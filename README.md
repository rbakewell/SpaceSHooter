# SpaceShooter

This was my final project for a Java class.
We were given the gameNet package and I used the quick click game.
In the quick click game you play against multiple players to click as many disks as you can before there gone.
That game made me think of asteroids so I modified it by disabling the clicking the disks part and added space ships.
